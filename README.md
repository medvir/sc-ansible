## sc-ansible

Ansible playbook to configure a _pet_ instance on Science Cloud.


### Instructions

So far this only configures `timavo`, a 16.04 LTS Ubuntu, with specific
configuration/software.

`ansible` must available on your local machine (you might also need `aptitude`
on the remote machine), simply check out and run `./ansible`.
